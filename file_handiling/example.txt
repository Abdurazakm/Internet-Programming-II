Introduction to File Handling 
File handling allows web applications to interact with files on the server. This is essential for tasks like 
storing user data, logging events, and managing configuration settings. Without file handling, web 
applications would rely solely on databases, which might not be practical for all types of data storage. 
Key reasons for file handling include:
 Data persistence, where files store information like user preferences between sessions
 Logging, which helps web applications track user actions, errors, and events for debugging and 
monitoring 
 Configuration management, where settings are saved in files for flexibility and easy customization 
 Content management, enabling websites with dynamic content, such as blogs or news sites, to store 
and serve content efficiently
